# Now that you have installed the Go release on your system, you need to set environment variables. Running the following three commands will set the required environment variable paths:

```
$export GOROOT=/usr/local/go 
$export GOPATH=＄HOME/Projects/Proj1  
$export PATH=＄GOPATH/bin:＄GOROOT/bin:＄PATH
```

# With this, you have successfully installed and set up your Go workplace. Check if everything is working properly by checking the version, using the following command:

```
$go version
$go run main.go
```
